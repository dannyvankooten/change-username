Change Username
================

The Change Username plugin allows you to change the usernames of your WordPress users in an easy and effective way.

We found that existing plugins to change a username did not scale at all when a site had many different users. This plugin does not come with its own settings page but instead simply hooks into the "edit user" form.

This plugin requires PHP version 5.3 or later.
