Change Username
================

The **Change Username** plugin allows you to change usernames of your WordPress users in an easy & effective way.

Existing plugins like "Username Changer" do not scale for sites with many users, pulling in all users at once and stuffing them in a single `<select>` element. 

This plugin takes a different approach by simply modifying the default WordPress "edit user" page & processing the form over AJAX, resulting in a much leaner & faster experience.
